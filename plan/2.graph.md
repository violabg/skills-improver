Excellent clarification 👍
What you’re describing is **not a learning platform**, but an **AI Skill Gap & Career Readiness Advisor**.
I’ll realign the design around that vision and keep it **realistic, focused, and defensible**.

# 🎯 Refined Product Definition

## What the app _is_

An AI-powered web app that:

- **Identifies weaknesses** in a user’s skill set
  (via tests _and_ self-assessment)
- **Maps gaps to career goals or role changes**
- **Recommends the best way to fill those gaps**
  using **external learning resources**
- Covers **both hard skills and soft skills**

You **do not host courses**.
You **orchestrate assessment, reasoning, and guidance**.

That’s smart — less cost, more leverage.

# 🧠 Updated Skill Graph (Aligned to Your Vision)

We keep the graph, but shift emphasis to **assessment, gaps, and recommendations**.

---

## 🔷 Core nodes (updated)

### 1. **Skill**

Used for _both hard and soft skills_.

**Examples**

- Hard: “React Performance Optimization”
- Soft: “Stakeholder Communication”
- Meta: “Leadership Presence”

**Fields**

- `skill_id`
- `name`
- `category` (hard / soft / leadership)
- `domain` (Frontend, Management, Sales, etc.)
- `difficulty`
- `market_relevance`
- `assessable` (boolean)
- `transferable` (important for role switching)

---

### 2. **Role / Career Goal**

Includes **role transitions**, not just job titles.

**Examples**

- “Frontend Dev → Tech Lead”
- “Developer → Product Manager”
- “IC → People Manager”

**Fields**

- `role_id`
- `current_role`
- `target_role`
- `level`
- `description`

---

### 3. **Assessment**

Represents _how_ a skill is evaluated.

**Types**

- Quiz
- Scenario-based questions
- AI conversation
- Artifact analysis (CV, GitHub, writing)
- Self-assessment

**Fields**

- `assessment_id`
- `type`
- `skill_type` (hard / soft)
- `reliability_score`

---

### 4. **Resource**

External learning resource (you don’t own it).

**Examples**

- Coursera course
- YouTube playlist
- FreeCodeCamp module
- Blog series
- Books

**Fields**

- `resource_id`
- `provider`
- `url`
- `cost` (free / paid)
- `estimated_time`
- `resource_type`

---

## 🔶 Relationships (gap-centric)

### 1. **REQUIRES**

Same as before, works for soft skills too.

```
(Leadership Communication)
  -[:REQUIRES]-> (Emotional Intelligence)
```

---

### 2. **NEEDED_FOR**

```
(Skill) -[:NEEDED_FOR {weight}]-> (Role)
```

Used to compute **role readiness**.

---

### 3. **ASSESSED_BY**

```
(Skill) -[:ASSESSED_BY]-> (Assessment)
```

Multiple assessments increase confidence.

---

### 4. **SUGGESTS_RESOURCE**

```
(Skill) -[:SUGGESTS_RESOURCE {effectiveness}]-> (Resource)
```

Resources are **gap fillers**, not curriculum.

---

### 5. **TRANSFERABLE_TO**

```
(Skill) -[:TRANSFERABLE_TO]-> (Skill)
```

Key for **career switching**:

- e.g. “Stakeholder Communication” → “Client Management”

---

## 👤 User edges (gap-first)

### 1. **CLAIMS_SKILL**

User-declared level.

```
(User) -[:CLAIMS_SKILL {level}]-> (Skill)
```

Low reliability, but useful.

---

### 2. **TESTED_ON**

```
(User) -[:TESTED_ON {score, confidence}]-> (Assessment)
```

---

### 3. **HAS_SKILL**

**Derived**, not manually entered.

```
(User) -[:HAS_SKILL {level, certainty}]-> (Skill)
```

Computed from:

- tests
- self-assessment
- AI analysis

---

### 4. **TARGETS_ROLE**

```
(User) -[:TARGETS_ROLE]-> (Role)
```

---

# 🧮 Gap Detection Logic (core feature)

For each skill required by the target role:

```
gap = required_level – user_level
```

Then rank gaps by:

- role impact
- prerequisite chain depth
- transferability
- soft vs hard balance

---

# 🤖 How AI Works in This App

### 1. **Assessment Generation**

- Generate adaptive tests per skill
- Scenario-based soft skill evaluation
- AI interviews (“How would you handle…”)

### 2. **Confidence Calibration**

AI detects:

- overconfidence
- underconfidence
- inconsistent answers

### 3. **Gap Explanation**

> “You’re strong technically, but your communication skills are limiting your move to Tech Lead.”

### 4. **Resource Matching**

AI ranks **external resources** by:

- skill gap size
- time available
- learning style
- free vs paid preference

---

# 🌍 Free / Public Learning Resource APIs

You _can_ legally link to many platforms:

### ✅ Good options

- **YouTube Data API** (playlists, channels)
- **Coursera Catalog API** (limited but usable)
- **edX public catalog**
- **FreeCodeCamp (open content)**
- **OpenCourseWare (MIT, Stanford)**
- **Udemy affiliate links** (monetization)

You store **metadata + links**, not content.

---

# 🧠 Soft Skills: Your Differentiator

Most tools ignore this — you shouldn’t.

### Example soft skills graph

```
Conflict Resolution
  ├─ REQUIRES → Active Listening
  ├─ REQUIRES → Emotional Regulation
  └─ NEEDED_FOR → Team Lead
```

### Assessments

- Role-play simulations
- Written responses
- AI-evaluated scenarios
- 360° feedback (future feature)

---

# Implementation note: chosen datastore

**Primary datastore**: PostgreSQL (Neon) using Prisma ORM. Model graph relationships using `Skill` and `SkillRelation` tables and use recursive CTEs for traversals and prerequisite resolution. Neo4j is deferred — adopt only if profiling shows significant advantages for graph-heavy queries.

**Vector DB**: Deferred to Phase 2. Do not add vector DB in Phase 0 unless a validated embedding use-case exists. Candidate providers: Weaviate, Pinecone, Milvus.

# 🧱 MVP Scope (Very Focused)

**Target persona**

- Professionals aiming for **internal role change**

**MVP features**

- Skill self-assessment + AI validation
- Soft + hard skill gap analysis
- Career goal selection
- External resource recommendations
- Clear “What to work on next” plan

No content hosting. No course creation.

---

# 💰 Monetization

- Subscription (career plan)
- One-time “Career Switch Report”
- B2B (HR internal mobility tool)
- Affiliate revenue from courses

---

# 🚀 Next logical steps (pick one)

1. Design **AI assessment flows** (hard + soft skills)
2. Define **prompt strategies** for skill evaluation
3. Build **gap ranking algorithm**
4. Choose **initial career paths** to support
5. UX flow from onboarding → gap report

Tell me which one you want next and I’ll go deep.
