Great choice — **#9 has real long-term value and a clear AI advantage**. Let’s go deep 👇

## 🎓 **Learning Path Generator – AI Skill Gap & Growth Engine**

### 💡 Core concept

An AI-powered web app that **builds and continuously adapts personalized learning paths** based on:

- current skills (real, not self-declared)
- target role or goal
- learning speed & preferences
- real-world performance feedback

Unlike course platforms, this is **goal-first**, not content-first.

---

## 🎯 Who it’s for

- **Professionals** reskilling or upskilling (devs, PMs, designers)
- **Companies** creating growth plans for employees
- **Career switchers**
- **Lifelong learners** who feel overwhelmed by content

---

## 🧠 How AI is used (the real value)

### 1. **Skill Graph Modeling**

- Represent skills as a **graph**, not a list
- Understand dependencies (e.g. React → hooks → performance → testing)
- Detect missing prerequisites

### 2. **True Skill Assessment**

Not just quizzes:

- Analyze GitHub repos, coding challenges, writing samples
- Compare output quality vs target level
- Detect _confidence vs competence_ gaps

### 3. **Adaptive Path Generation**

- Break goal into milestones
- Choose _minimum effective learning units_
- Reorder dynamically based on progress

### 4. **Continuous Feedback Loop**

- Learner submits:

  - exercises
  - projects
  - reflections

- AI updates skill confidence scores in real time

## 🧩 Key features

1. **Goal Definition**

   - “Become Senior Frontend Developer”
   - “Move into Tech Lead role”
   - “Learn ML enough to ship products”

2. **Skill Gap Visualization**

   - Radar / graph view
   - “You’re 62% ready for your goal”

3. **Daily / Weekly Learning Plan**

   - 30–90 min chunks
   - Theory + practice + validation

4. **AI Coach**

   - Explains _why_ a topic matters
   - Adjusts when user struggles or speeds ahead
   - Keeps motivation high

5. **Outcome-Based Validation**

   - “You can now do X”
   - Proof via artifacts (code, docs, designs)

## 🛠️ Suggested architecture

- **Frontend:** Next.js / React (App Router) — server-side rendering and server components where appropriate
- **Backend:** Node.js / TypeScript — Next.js App Router server routes + oRPC procedures for typed backend contracts; Prisma ORM for DB access
- **LLM / AI Orchestration:** AI SDK v6 (model-agnostic; recommend Groq/Kimi2 early) executed from server-side domain services
- **Skill Graph (primary):** PostgreSQL (Neon) modeled via Prisma with recursive CTEs for graph traversals. Neo4j is deferred unless graph use-cases show native graph benefits.
- **Vector DB:** Deferred to Phase 2 (only add after validating embedding use cases). Initially store metadata and derived signals; list candidate providers (Weaviate, Pinecone, Milvus) in the implementation plan.
- **Integrations:** GitHub, LeetCode, Coursera, Udemy, YouTube (store metadata/links only)

- **Component Library:** shadcn/ui with `base-ui` primitives is the preferred component library. Note: `base-ui` does not support the `asChild` prop pattern — do not use `asChild`. Use the `render` prop or explicit wrapper components and the library's composition primitives instead.

---

## Engineering requirements (mandatory)

- **Authentication**: Use the `better-auth` library for authentication. MVP will implement GitHub login (OAuth) only.

## 🧪 MVP (very realistic)

**Narrow niche** → huge advantage.

Example MVP:

- Target: **Frontend developers**
- Goal: “React → Senior level”
- Inputs:

  - GitHub repo analysis
  - Short diagnostic tasks

- Output:

  - 6–8 week adaptive learning path
  - Weekly reassessment

Ship in **6 weeks**.

## 💰 Monetization

- **B2C:** subscription (€15–30/month)
- **B2B:** per-employee growth plans
- **Upsell:** certifications, coaching, assessments
- **White-label** for bootcamps

---

## 🧠 Why this can win

Most platforms:

- push courses
- ignore prior knowledge
- don’t adapt

This:

- minimizes wasted time
- proves progress
- feels like a **personal mentor**

---

## 🔥 Expansion ideas

- Team skill maps
- Promotion readiness scores
- AI-driven mentorship matching
- Learning ROI for companies

---

## ⚠️ Hard but defensible

- Skill modeling is hard → moat
- Feedback loops improve model over time
- User data creates long-term advantage

---

If you want, next I can:

- Design the **skill graph schema**
- Define **AI prompts & evaluation logic**
- Narrow it to a **specific profession**
- Outline a **go-to-market strategy**

Just tell me where you want to go next 🚀
