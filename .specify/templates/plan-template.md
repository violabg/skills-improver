# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Runtime preference**: Node.js / TypeScript with Next.js App Router (recommended). If another runtime is chosen, justify trade-offs.
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

Gates determined from the project constitution (required checks before Phase 0):

- **Learner-Centered Design**: Plan MUST include measurable learner outcomes and at least one acceptance scenario that demonstrates value.
- **Evidence-Based Assessment**: Any assessment/measurement introduced MUST include a description of signals/data used and a plan for validation (datasets or simulations).
- **Privacy & Data Minimization**: Plans that collect user data MUST list the minimal data elements, retention period, and encryption/access controls.
- **Test-First Development**: Plan MUST list required tests (unit, contract, integration) and how they will be executed in CI.
- **Simplicity & Incremental Delivery**: Plan MUST provide an MVP checkpoint with measurable success criteria and an incremental delivery path.

- **AI Output Validation**: Any plan that uses AI for assessments MUST include schema definitions (Zod or similar) and a validation/fallback strategy.
- **Evidence & Privacy**: Plans that request user evidence uploads MUST include consent copy, minimal data elements, and retention policy entries.
- **Vector DB Strategy**: If using a vector DB, the plan MUST state whether it is Phase 1 (deferred) or Phase 2 (required), list the provider options, and justify costs.

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
